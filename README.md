# NightLyfe

### NightLyfe is a QHacks 2022 submission to simplify venue entry with COVID vaccination & ID verification in one, plus live capacity updates.

The system contains three subsystems:
1. The iOS consumer-facing app built using SwiftUI (Code contained within this repository)
2. The backend system built using GraphQL
3. The remote control hardware for venue bouncers built using ESP32s

NightLyfe is designed to streamline the verification of COVID vaccination status at clubs and bars. NightLyfe revolutionizes the traditional process by seamlessly merging a user's COVID passport and scanned driver's license into a single, verified user account.

Imagine arriving at a NightLyfe-supported venue, where the bouncer effortlessly verifies your age and vaccination status by simply holding their remote next to your phone. This cutting-edge technology not only ensures compliance with health regulations but also enhances the overall experience for patrons and venue staff alike.

Furthermore, NightLyfe provides real-time insights with its live capacity count feature, allowing both venue operators and attendees to monitor crowd levels and plan their night accordingly.

With NightLyfe, enjoying a safe and vibrant nightlife has never been easier or more efficient.

This project was completed with the help of Dylan Lanigan, Pieter Baerts, and Joe Maly.

## Learnings
> Leave time for sleep. Leave time for presentation. Functionality can't carry the entire project. Plan more than you think. Trust the Brian Eno cards. Don't listen to Dylan when he says: "new backend features will be done in 5 minutes just a sec". - Dylan Lanigan
